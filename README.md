# RedliningExploration

The Google Colaboratory file contained in this repository contains work inspired by a project on educational inequality in the Philadelphia-area schools, which led me to consider the impacts of redlining on the city.

I downloaded redlining files (GeoJSON) from The University of Richmond Digital Scholarship Lab's Mapping Inequality project (wich everyone should check out, it's awesome work), as well as crime data from the City of Philadelphia's Open Data platform. 

The University of Richmond data is contained in the repo, which can just be downloaded, but the city crime data is so large that it cannot (it can be found at the link (here)[https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents].
